# Video-Game-Mania

This project was complete during my senior year of highschool

It makes use of the unity framework and game engine

All code is mine aside from the tetris code, which had some minor modifcation to support a score system
- the appropriate credit is given in each program file

if there is nothing on this repo that means it is still uploading, thank you
